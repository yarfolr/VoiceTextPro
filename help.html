				<h1>Help — How this site works</h1>
				<p>
					This demo is a minimal client-side speech-to-text playground built for
					demonstration and local use.
				</p>

				<h3>Important notes & limitations</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The site uses your browser's built-in SpeechRecognition (Web Speech
						API). Not all browsers support it. Chrome (desktop) and some
						Chromium-based browsers have better support.
					</li>
					<li>
						Transcription quality depends on the browser engine, microphone
						quality, and selected language.
					</li>
					<li>
						Uploading audio files does <em>not</em> automatically produce
						perfect transcription. The "Transcribe while playing" option will
						play your uploaded audio and use the microphone to capture it — this
						relies on your system capturing speaker output via microphone, which
						is not ideal. For accurate audio-file transcription you would
						normally use a server-side model (e.g., Whisper) or cloud
						Speech-to-Text APIs.
					</li>
					<li>
						When recording live (Record), the app requests microphone
						permission. Allow it. The live transcription appears as you speak.
						Use headphones or quiet environment for best results.
					</li>
					<li>
						After recording you can download the transcript as .txt or copy to
						clipboard.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How to use</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Click "Let's start" on the landing page.</li>
					<li>
						Choose your language from the grid. The app will use that language
						for recognition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Either paste text, upload a .txt or audio file, or record using your
						microphone.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you upload audio, press "Play uploaded" to listen, or "Transcribe
						while playing" to try to capture it via your microphone (requires
						mic permission).
					</li>
					<li>
						To record live: press Record → Start recording, speak, then Stop.
						The transcribed text will appear live.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>New Features</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>History:</strong> Your transcriptions are automatically
						saved and can be accessed through the History button in the menu.
						The last 10 transcriptions are stored locally in your browser.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Settings:</strong> Customize your experience through the
						Settings menu:
						<ul>
							<li>Theme selection (dark mode, with light mode coming soon)</li>
							<li>Toggle automatic saving of transcriptions</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Enhanced Navigation:</strong> The new menu provides quick
						access to History, Settings, and Help, with intuitive icons for
						better usability.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Privacy</h3>
				<p>
					This is a local client-side demo and does not send your audio or text
					to any server. However, speech recognition engines are implemented by
					the browser vendor and may send audio to their services depending on
					implementation. Check your browser's privacy policy if this is a
					concern.
